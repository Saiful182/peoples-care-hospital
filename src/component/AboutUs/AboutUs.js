                <h2>Our Contrbution</h2>
                <p>After the liberation war, the health sector of Bangladesh was completely deprived due to various political instability and uncertainity. Unfortunately a significant number of people of this country died on that time only because of incomplete diagnosis of disease and lack of better treatment. When the sufferings were beyond the limit, at that time we established Peoples Care Centre Ltd. in Elephant Road, Dhaka. Our goal was to ensure modern treatment facilities for the mass people of the country.

                    Peoples Carestarted its journey in June 1983 and within few days due to its accuracy of the reports and quality of the service Peoples Carebecame an unparallel symbol of reliability and trust from the end of respective doctors and the people of our country.</p>
